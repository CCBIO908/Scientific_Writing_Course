> Information works in parallell with Mittuib/Canvas, to make sure non-ECT participants easily can access the same information, as some of you have reported trouble with accessing the student pages. Apologize for those who get this information twice. For ECT-earning students, your main site will still be https://mitt.uib.no/courses/50763

## Message 2 (May 13):
See program below: When course starts, you are expected to:
  - Be on time!   
  - Make room for everyone in the auditorium, as course is full.
  - Engage in discussions, ask questions during the course!

Also, this is a reminder about assignment 1, with deadline within the 15 May (voluntary for non-ECTs).
Note, you can freely choose the subject for your problem statement, but my recommendation is to use text you are working on, so it is relevant and useful for you.
