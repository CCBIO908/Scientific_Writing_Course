> Information works in parallell with Mittuib/Canvas, to make sure non-ECT participants easily can access the same information, as some of you have reported trouble with accessing the student pages.  
  Apologize for those who get this information twice. For ECT-earning students, your main site will still be https://mitt.uib.no/courses/50763
